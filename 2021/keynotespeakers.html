        <!-- <p>Kuansan Wang is a Principal Researcher and Managing Director of Microsoft Research Outreach where
          he is responsible for engaging with the global academic community on jointly advancing the state-ofthe-
          art in the areas MSR conducts research. He is leading a team that conducts research on web-scale
          machine reading, intelligent inference, deep semantic analytics and user behavior modeling. In addition
          to contributing to the development of Microsoft Bing and Cortana, the technologies developed at his team
          can also be seen in Microsoft Academic services that include a search engine at academic.microsoft.com
          and the Academic Knowledge API available through Microsoft Cognitive Services. Dr. Wang joined MSR
          in 1998 as a researcher in speech technology group where he conducted research in language modeling
          and multimodal interactions. He then became a software architect for Microsoft speech product group,
          responsible for Microsoft Speech Server and Response Point, and represented Microsoft to W3C, ECMA
          and ISO to help author international standards in speech, language and communication areas. He returned
          to MSR to work on web search in 2007 and has been a key driving force to evolve web search from a
          keyword based to semantic based paradigm. Kuansan received his BS from National Taiwan University
          and MS and PhD as an NSF Fellow from University of Maryland, College Park, all in electrical engineering.

        <h2 id="updates">Highlight</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2025/Workshop/SDProc">Submission site</a> is now available. All deadlines below are at 23:59 UTC-12 (Anywhere on Earth).</li>
          <li>The title and abstract submission deadline (main workshop) is <strong>March 1, 2025</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You are invited to participate in the 5th Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing (SDP 2025) to be held at ACL 2025 in Vienna, Austria. SDP 2025 will consist of a research track and four shared tasks. The call for research papers is described below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Papers must follow the ACL format and conform to the ACL 2025 Submission Guidelines. Paper submission has to be done through openreview: <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2025/Workshop/SDProc">5th SDP at ACL 2025 Workshop</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Scholarly literature is the chief means by which scientists and academics document and communicate their results and is therefore critical to the advancement of knowledge and improvement of human well-being. 
          At the same time, this literature poses challenges to NLP uncommon in other genres, such as specialized language and high background knowledge requirements, long documents and strong structural conventions, multimodal presentation, citation relationships among documents, an emphasis on rational argumentation, and the frequent availability of detailed metadata and experimental data. 
          These challenges necessitate the development of NLP methods and resources optimized for this domain. The Scholarly Document Processing (SDP) workshop provides a venue for discussing these challenges, bringing together stakeholders from different communities including computational linguistics, machine learning, text mining, information retrieval, digital libraries, scientometrics and others, to develop methods, tasks, and resources in support of these goals.
        </p>

        <p>
         This workshop builds on the success of prior workshops: the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th SDP workshops held at EMNLP 2020, NAACL 2021, COLING 2022, and ACL 2024, and the 1st and 2nd SciNLP workshops held at AKBC 2020 and 2021. In addition to having broad appeal within the NLP community, we hope the SDP workshop will attract researchers from other relevant fields including meta-science, scientometrics, data mining, information retrieval, and digital libraries, bringing together these disparate communities within ACL.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>This workshop will accept direct submissions as well as papers submitted through ACL Rolling Review.</p> -->

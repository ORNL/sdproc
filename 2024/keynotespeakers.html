        <h3>How to InterText? Elevating NLP to the cross-document level</h3>
        <p>While modern language models do a great job at finding documents, extracting information
          from them and generating naturally sounding language, the progress in helping humans read, connect,
          and make sense of interrelated long texts has been very much limited. Funded by the European Research
          Council, the InterText project brings natural language processing (NLP) forward by developing a general
          framework for modeling and analyzing fine-grained relationships between texts – intertextual relation-
          ships. This crucial milestone for AI would allow tracing the origin and evolution of texts and ideas and
          enable a new generation of AI applications for text work and critical reading. Using the scientific domain
          as a prototypical model of collaborative knowledge construction anchored in text, this talk will provide
          an overview of UKP Lab’s past and ongoing research demonstrating our intertextual approach to NLP
          in the scientific domain. Specifically, we will highlight two lines of our work. The first one is related
          to task design, practical applications and intricacies of data collection in the peer-review domain. The
          second one is about scientific text generation targeting (i) citation text and (ii) attitude and theme-guided
          rebuttals. To conclude, we will briefly describe our ongoing efforts towardsfine-grained linking of mul-
          tiple documents, temporal analysis of scientific datasets and research novelty modeling.</p>

        <h3>Large language models as research assistants: workflows and challenges</h3>
        <p>
          Research practices in our and other fields are being actively reshaped by the new tools based
          on large language models. For every step in the traditional research pipeline, from experimentation to
          writing, commercial ‘solutions’ are already actively marketed. This talk will discuss to what extent the
          marketing is realistic, how the research practices seem to be changing, and how all this interacts with
          considerations of publication ethics and security.

        <h3>AI Plays Medicinal Chemist</h3>
        <p>
          There exist approximately 166 billion small molecules, with 970 million deemed druglike.
          Despite this vast pool, only 89 tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently approved across global healthca-
          re systems. This scarcity underscores the urgent need for innovative approaches, calling upon the NLP
          community to contribute significantly to medicine. However, the challenges are manifold. Existing large
          language models (LLMs) alone are insufficient due to their tendency to generate erroneous claims con-
          fidently (hallucinate). Moreover, traditional knowledge bases do not adequately address the issue; none
          of the 89 kinase inhibitors are documented in popular human-constructed databases. This gap persists
          because chemistry language diverges significantly from natural language, demanding specialized domain
          knowledge, multimodal information integration, and long context understanding. Using drug discovery
          as a case study, I will present our approaches to tackle these challenges and turn an AI agent into a Medi-
          cinal Chemist. I will share preliminary results from animal testing conducted on drug variants proposed
          by AI algorithms. Furthermore, I advocate for a paradigm shift towards ‘slow science’, emphasizing the
          integration of feedback loops from molecule synthesis and animal testing. This new paradigm aims to
          evaluate AI techniques in scientific contexts, moving beyond chasing precision/recall scores at leader-
          boards which are prevalent in the current computer science community.

        <h3><a href="https://sdproc.org/2024/keynote_Doug.pdf">Chasing high-precision NLP at discount prices: Lessons for accelerating science</a></h3>
        <p>
          Natural language processing (NLP) has made major strides in recent years, due to the in-
        creasing capabilities of large language models. However, using NLP to power real applications is still
        challenging: the best models are expensive to apply at scale and are still prone to errors. I’ll describe re-
        cent lessons we’ve learned on the Semantic Scholar team as we’ve built and deployed applications using
        NLP aimed at accelerating science, including PDF content extraction, automatically-constructed topic
        pages for science, and complex question answering. While recent NLP breakthroughs do enable exciting
        new experiences, fully delivering on the potential of this technology will require solving multiple open
        research problems.
